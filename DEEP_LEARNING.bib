  abstract    = {To a large extent, traffic control and traffic information services depend on accurate information about the situation on the road network. Often rough estimates of queue lengths are no longer sufficient to give a reasonable prediction of travel times. Traditionally the situation on the road network is derived from local measurements (e.g. induction loops). It is difficult to obtain travel time estimates from local speed and flow data. It is especially difficult in urban areas. When the positions of a sufficient number of vehicles can be frequently communicated to a central site, travel times can be directly measured. This is called floating car data (FCD). This paper gives the major results of the Prelude trial and the ways in which FCD can be used. The Prelude FCD-trial in the Netherlands had as its primary aim to investigate the technical feasibility of using FCD to accurately measure travel times in a mixed urban and motorway network. FCD has a broad range of applications. The applications range from real time data for traffic management to the compilation of very accurate origin-destination matrices complete with travel times.},

  abstract = {In 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, one preferably determines free-flow speed by deriving it from a speed study involving the existing facility or on a comparable facility if the facility is in the planning stage. Many have used a `rule of thumb' by adding 10 km/h (5 mi/h) above the posted limit to obtain free-flow speed without justification. Two team members using a radar gun and manual tally sheets collected 1668 speed observations at ten sites during several weeks. Each site had a unique posted speed limit sign ranging from 30 km/h (20 mi/h) to 120 km/h (75 mi/h). Five sites were on urban streets. Three sites were on multilane highways, and two on freeways. Goodness-of-fit test results revealed that a Gaussian distribution generally fit the speed distributions at each site at a 5{\%} level of significance. The best-fit model had a correlation coefficient of +0.99. The posted speed limit variable was significant at 5{\%} level of significance. Examining data by highway type revealed that average free-flow speeds are strongly associated with posted speed limits with correlation coefficients of +0.99, +1.00, and +1.00 for urban streets, multilane highways, and freeways, respectively.},
